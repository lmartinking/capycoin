# CapyCoin! ü™ô

‚ú® A toy implementation of a non-distributed fixed circulation currency system! ‚ú®

_Using the power of Rust and SQLite!_

## Features!

 * Create an account (and receive an access token)
 * Get account information (funds, creation date)
 * Get transactions (to/from, amount, fee, transaction date)
 * Get a single transaction information
 * Create a transaction

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!

This is a toy project, which I used to learn Rust. There are **no guarantees of any security**,
and it has not been subject to security review.

There has also been no optimisation in terms of transaction volume, scaling, etc.

## Economics

The system is a closed circulation monetary system. The coin is non-divisible.

There is a "seed" account `4e9b616a-f11e-48b6-8c2f-9534d482e48e` which has 100,000 coin
when the database is created.

There is no "mint coin" functionality, but it would be trivial to add.

## System Design

### Core

The "core" of CapyCoin is a single threaded process which uses a SQLite database to hold accounts
and record transactions.

It listens for messages on a Unix (datagram) socket. Any clients which connect to this socket are
considered "trusted", so the intention is that the gateway and other internal applications connect
to provide user services.

### Gateway

The "gateway" is the user facing component of CapyCoin. This provides provision and validation
of access tokens which are associated with an account and have a expiry of 30 days.

This gateway provides a simple REST API which clients can use to interact with the core.

The gateway is threaded, as the token validation uses `bcrypt` which is an algorithm that
is intentionally slow to compute in order to make brute force attacks impractical.

The **seed account** is not accessible from the gateway service as it has no provisioned
access token.

## Get Started!

### Get the services running

 1. Install rust (eg: via `rustup`)
 2. `cargo build`
 3. `cargo run` (run the core)
 4. `cargo run --bin client_gateway` (run the client gateway, in a separate terminal)

## REST API Example

(In the following examples, the gateway is listening on `http://localhost:8000`)

Clients should set `Authentication: Bearer {TOKEN}` for all endpoints, except account creation.

We will use the account ID `ab62ad1e-eeaa-406a-acdb-4a43c63fda25` for these examples. These IDs are randomly generated v4 UUIDs. The dashes between the characters are optional.

### Create an Account

NOTE: When created, accounts have no funds.

## TODO

 * Client signing of transactions (ED25519). This would necessitate a client providing their public key
   at account creation time.

 * Transaction fees. I had a bit of a fun idea that any fees could go into a "fee account", and
   there could be a special service which pays out all active user accounts a stipend every day?
